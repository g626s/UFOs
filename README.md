# UFOs
Created a website that displays UFO-sightings data and built a table using that data stored in a JavaScript array. Created filters to make this table fully dynamic, reacting to user input using Javascript, HTML/CSS. Website was customized using Bootstrap, and equipped the table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with the websiteâ€™s visualizations.
